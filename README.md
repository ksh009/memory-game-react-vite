# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Of course! Here's a simple guide on how to start up a React project using Vite:

# Getting Started with React and Vite

## Introduction

Vite is a fast build tool that provides instant server start and hot module replacement (HMR) for React projects. In this guide, I'll walk you through the steps to get the Memory Game up and running.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher) or yarn (v1.22.0 or higher)

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Next, install the project dependencies by running either `npm install` or `yarn`:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

## Step 2: Start the Development Server

To start the development server and run your React application, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server and open your default web browser to display the running application.

## Additional Configuration

- **Build for Production**: To build your React application for production, run `npm run build` or `yarn build`. This will generate a production-ready build in the `dist` directory.

- **Custom Configuration**: You can customize Vite's behavior by modifying the `vite.config.js` file in the project root. Refer to the [Vite Configuration Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/config/) for more information.

## Running Tests

To start the test runner, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```
